# Assessment Background

## Background

An essential component of any educational research is a validated, relevant instrument to measure students' learning outcomes. Whether to award college credit like the College Board's AP and CLEP exams, to measure students' previously-held misconceptions, or just as a tool upon which to evaluate educational interventions, such assessments have been developed and statistically analyzed for a wide range of subjects such as Spanish, Psychology, Chemistry, and Calculus [@clep; @psychinventory; @cheminventory; @calcinventory].

In the field of statistics, previous work on measuring students' reasoning skills led to the development of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS). The revised CAOS 4, comprising 40 multiple-choice items on a variety of commonly-taught first-semester introductory concepts, was first administered in 2005 and allowed instructors to measure whether their courses were successfully resulting in their desired learning outcomes. However, many instructors noted that their findings reflected a much lower understanding than expected, specifically regarding the topics of data visualization and data collection [@delmas]. However, a key feature of the CAOS was the lack of hard computation nor need to recall specific formulas or definitions, allowing greater accessibility for a variety of statistics-adjacent uses.

In 2022, as more universities begin to support the emerging field of data science via specific courses, concentrations, or even majors, there is a need to measure students' learning outcomes in these introductory classes analogously to the subjects named above [@prevalence]. Lacking a clearly-defined scope, empirical studies of so called "data science" curricula suggest that the field can be thought of an augmentation of traditional statistical modeling concepts, with emphases on computing, data visualization and manipulation, as well as a consideration of ethics and the role data plays in society [@dsdefinition].
