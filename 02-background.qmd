# Assessment Background {.unnumbered}

## Background

An essential component of any educational research is a validated, relevant instrument to measure students' learning outcomes. Whether to award college credit like the College Board's AP and CLEP exams, to measure students' previously-held misconceptions, or just as a tool upon which to evaluate educational interventions, such assessments have been developed and statistically analyzed for a wide range of subjects such as Spanish, Psychology, Chemistry, and Calculus [@clep; @psychinventory; @cheminventory; @calcinventory].

In the field of statistics, previous work on measuring students' reasoning skills led to the development of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS). The revised CAOS 4, comprising 40 multiple-choice items on a variety of commonly-taught first-semester introductory concepts, was first administered in 2005 and allowed instructors to measure whether their courses were successfully resulting in their desired learning outcomes. However, many instructors noted that their findings reflected a much lower understanding than expected, specifically regarding the topics of data visualization and data collection [@delmas]. However, a key feature of the CAOS was the lack of hard computation nor need to recall specific formulas or definitions, allowing greater accessibility for a variety of statistics-adjacent uses.

In 2022, as more universities begin to support the emerging field of data science via specific courses, concentrations, or even majors, there is a need to measure students' learning outcomes in these introductory classes analogously to the subjects named above [@prevalence]. Lacking a clearly-defined scope, empirical studies of so called "data science" curricula suggest that the field can be thought of an augmentation of traditional statistical modeling concepts, with emphases on computing, data visualization and manipulation, as well as a consideration of ethics and the role data plays in society [@dsdefinition].

good places to start: read DelMas 2007 paper, look at what theyve done to get it beginnning to end, at some point acknowledge that were not finishing with just my theiss (analyzing student data, subscale stuff that wont be part of my thesis)

refer to this for background: https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf

in on eo fthe earlier sections, summary of data science courses and what they cover (and compare and contrast to our assessment). developed collectively based on the faculty and what they teach/what ive taken, but also capturing most of what's "out there"

are there any papers on: teaching data science with or without code, kind of justify our choice for language agnosticism

Just found this paper and thought you all would find it interesting:

add one sentence on like: its in high schools too!


ask andy/chelsey--do they have other good references how to run think aloud interviews
