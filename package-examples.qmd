![A sample question with associated code chunk](dsbox-figs/02-question.png){fig-alt="The image is a screenshot of a computer application, with the exercise title \"Most common names\" at the top. The text below prompts the user to use the subsequent code chunk to find the three most common first names of LEGO purchasers. The code chunk contains buttons to start over, obtain a hint, run the code, and check it against the solution. The code written is lego_sales, pipe operator, new line, and blanks to prompt the user to fill in a function call. Below the code chunk is a radio button question with 5 options."}
