started with all questions in one document, joined with some discussions on items coverage and stuff
put stuff in easy format to browse
ran 3 interviews with faculty
  CS coverage, potential focus on different topics
  summarising feedback from live sessions, working with the rest of the group to incorporate
  highlight a few things: one thing that hadn't really thought about that Kristin pointed out, something we hadnt thoguht about that Amelia/Nick pointed out. one paragraph each, nothing crazy but just explaining what its like to get feedback
  
  with students with exposure: goal is to see if these topics are in your wheelhouse and if wording makes sense as a student


big themes: balancing size and pacing, not buying lede in ethics questions, how to write questions that arent too obvious and get at specific things, think about spacing out ethics quetsions to not prime

somethign good would be good to have content: use 15 passages and assign them to rough buckets
